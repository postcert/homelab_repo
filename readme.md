# Homelab MonoRepo
Slowly transitioning homelab cluster configuration to a centralized git repo.
Have a lot of config and containers/vm that are in some cases 5+ years old, cleaning up some of the TF and configuration dumping it here as I get to it.

## proxmox_isntances
TF + Ansible for some lxc instances.

## proxmox_config
Ansible to run against proxmox hosts for updating/configuration/etc
